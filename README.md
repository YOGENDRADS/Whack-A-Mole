# Whack-A-Mole
 some steps to build a whack-a-mole game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
Create the HTML structure for the game, using semantic tags like <header> and <main>.
Include elements for game information, such as the score and timer, and the game container with mole holes.
Use CSS to style the game and create an appealing layout.
Create a CSS file to apply styles to the game elements, including the background, mole holes, and mole images.
Implement the logic with JavaScript. The logic includes:
Creating the board
Making an interval
Creating a random mole in a hole
Listening event when the mole is clicked
Increasing the score
