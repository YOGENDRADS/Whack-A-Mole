# Whack-A-Mole
 some steps to build a whack-a-mole game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
 
Create the HTML structure for the game, using semantic tags like <header> and <main>.

Include elements for game information, such as the score and timer, and the game container with mole holes.

Use CSS to style the game and create an appealing layout.

Create a CSS file to apply styles to the game elements, including the background, mole holes, and mole images.

Implement the logic with JavaScript. The logic includes:

Creating the board

Making an interval

Creating a random mole in a hole

Listening event when the mole is clicked

Increasing the score

Here are some JavaScript functions for a whack-a-mole game:

Create a random amount of time: The mole will peep for a random amount of time.

Choose a random hole: The mole will peep from a random hole.

Make the mole pop: The mole will pop from the random hole using the above functions.

Start the game: The game will start when the button is pressed.
